10. Click somewhere in the middle of the link connecting signal generator & sampler. Keep clicking at bends till you connect it to the other input of the scope.

11. Click on the scope, a new window will appear. It shows that the sinusoidal signal as well as sample in red dots.

12. Move the cursor from one sample to another by draging the slider provide along the x-axis and you will find sample values in the boxes at bottom left part of the window. Note the first 15 values in a note book. This 15 values will go as table 1 in your report.

13. In this window, you can change parameters like frequency, amplitude and phase angle of sinusoidal signal generator & sampling frequency.

14. Change the sinusoidal signal generator O/P amplitude to 1.5V and note 1st 15 values. This will form Table 2 in your report. In your observation & discussion part of the reporting, you have to compare Table 1 and Table 2.

15. Change sampling frequency to 43 Hz and amplitude of sinusoidal signal generator at 1V. Note first 15 readings to from Table 3. Compare Table 1 and Table 3
                    
<img src="images/expt54.jpg"  />
                            
16. Make sampling frequency 40Hz, amplitude of sinusoidal signal generator 10V, phase=30. Table 1st reading to from Table 4. Compare Table 1 and Table 4.
                    
<img src="images/expt55.jpg"  />
                               
17. Under sampling:Change the Sinusoidal signal generator frequency 50Hz, amplitude 1.4V, phase=0. Sampling frequency= 40 Hz. Take 1st 15 readings. This will from Table 5. Compare Table 1 and Table 5.
            
<img src="images/expt56.jpg"  />
                              
18. Change the Sinusoidal signal generator frequency=30Hz, Amplitude=1V, Phase=0, sampling frequency = 40Hz. Take 15 readings. This will produce Table 6. Compare Table 1 and Table 6
                      
<img src="images/expt57.jpg"  />
                             
19. Optional: Select sinusoidal signal generator frequency and sampling frequency simultaneously to form more Table, Table 7 and Table 8 which leads to nyquist rate from observation phenomenon.
